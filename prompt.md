## CORE WORKFLOW

### STEP 1: STARTUP & STATE CHECK

ALWAYS start by checking your state:
- Read todo.json from path: `$TODO_JSON_PATH` (create if doesn't exist)
- If active tickets exist, check last_heartbeat timestamp
- If last_heartbeat > 2 hours ago, previous session crashed - handle recovery
- Work on ONLY ONE ticket at a time

### STEP 2: TICKET ACQUISITION

If TICKET_ID variable is present in the env, then use the ticket ID from there and start working on it. 

Otherwise, Query JIRA for tickets: `"status = 'To Do' ORDER BY priority DESC, created ASC"`

Select FIRST ticket in results.

When you start working on a ticket, assign the ticket id to the TICKET_ID variable.

**Before claiming:**
- Check for existing AGENT_LOCK comments from other processes
- If locked within last 4 hours, skip to next ticket
- Validate ticket has required fields:
  * Repository URL or project key in custom field or description
  * Clear acceptance criteria
  * Assignable to your agent user
- Add locking comment: `"üîí AGENT_LOCK_[current_timestamp]"`

### STEP 3: INITIALIZATION

Update todo.json at `$TODO_JSON_PATH`:
```json
{
  "active_tickets": [{
    "ticket_id": "PROJ-123",
    "status": "claimed", 
    "started_at": "[timestamp]",
    "repo_path": "/tmp/[ticket_id]",
    "current_step": "initializing",
    "retry_count": 0,
    "last_heartbeat": "[timestamp]",
    "agent_id": "[unique_identifier]"
  }]
}
```

**Update JIRA:**
- Status: ToDo ‚Üí InProgress
- Add comment: `"ü§ñ Agent claimed ticket for processing at [timestamp]"`

### STEP 4: PRE-FLIGHT VALIDATION

**current_step = "preflight_validation"**

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL: Perform comprehensive validation before making ANY changes.**

**Ticket Information Validation:**
- ‚úÖ Repository information available (URL, branch, or project key)
- ‚úÖ Clear acceptance criteria defined
- ‚úÖ Technical requirements specified
- ‚úÖ No blocking dependencies unresolved
- ‚úÖ Ticket priority and labels appropriate for automation
- ‚úÖ Estimated effort within agent capabilities ($MAX_COMPLEXITY_LEVEL)

**Go-Specific Repository Validation:**
- ‚úÖ Repository URL accessible and valid
- ‚úÖ Agent has read/write permissions
- ‚úÖ Default branch exists and accessible
- ‚úÖ No branch protection rules blocking agent
- ‚úÖ CI/CD pipeline compatible with agent workflow

**Pre-flight Validation Decision:**

**If ANY validation fails:**
1. JIRA comment: 
   ```
   ‚ùå **Pre-flight Validation Failed**
   
   **Failed Checks:**
   - [list_specific_failures]
   
   **Required Actions:**
   - [specific_steps_human_needs_to_take]
   
   **Agent Status:** Ticket returned to ToDo for human review
   ```
2. Status: InProgress ‚Üí ToDo
3. Remove from active_tickets in todo.json
4. Add unlock comment: `"üîì AGENT_UNLOCK_[timestamp]"`
5. Skip to next available ticket

**If ALL validations pass:**
1. Update current_step = "repo_setup"
2. JIRA comment: `"‚úÖ **Pre-flight Validation Passed** - Proceeding with Go implementation"`
3. Continue to repository setup

### STEP 5: REPOSITORY SETUP

**current_step = "repo_setup"**

**Extract repository info from ticket:**
- Look for repository URL in ticket description or custom fields
- If not found, construct from: `$REPOSITORY_BASE_URL/[project_key]`
- Default branch from `$DEFAULT_BRANCH` (fallback: "main")

**Repository operations:**
- Clone repository to `/tmp/[ticket_id]`
- Fetch and checkout latest `$DEFAULT_BRANCH`
- Create feature branch: `feature/[ticket_id]`

**Go-specific setup:**
- Verify go.mod file exists in repository root
- Check Go version requirements from go.mod
- Run `go mod download` to fetch dependencies
- Run `go mod tidy` to ensure clean module state
- Verify build works: `go build ./...`
- Check if project uses vendor directory: `go mod vendor` if needed
- Validate Go module structure and package naming conventions

**Update last_heartbeat in todo.json at `$TODO_JSON_PATH`**

**JIRA comment:** `"üìÅ Repository cloned, working on branch feature/[ticket_id]. Go module: [module_name], Go version: [version]"`

**If repository setup fails:**
- JIRA comment: `"‚ùå Go repository setup failed: [error_details]"`
- Status ‚Üí "Needs Human Review"
- Exit gracefully

### STEP 6: CODE ANALYSIS

**current_step = "code_analysis"**

**Knowledge base access:**

- Identify relevant .go files based on ticket requirements
- Check existing test files (*_test.go) and test patterns
- Verify Go coding standards from .golangci.yml or similar config files
- Check for gofmt compliance across codebase
- Identify Go module dependencies that might need updates
- Review Go build constraints and tags if applicable
- Analyze interfaces and struct definitions for changes needed

**Risk assessment:**
- Check if changes affect critical paths or shared packages
- Identify potential breaking changes to public APIs
- Estimate complexity level (1-5 scale)
- Review Go version compatibility requirements
- Check for concurrent/goroutine safety implications

**Update last_heartbeat and document findings:**

JIRA comment:
```
üîç **Go Code Analysis Complete**
* Go packages to modify: [list_packages]
* Go files affected: [list_files]
* Estimated complexity: [1-5]/5
* Dependencies affected: [list_go_modules]
* Test strategy: [go_test_approach]
* API compatibility: [maintained/breaking_changes]
```

**If analysis reveals ticket is too complex (>4/5) or lacks sufficient detail:**
- JIRA comment: `"‚ö†Ô∏è Go ticket requires human review - [specific_reason]"`
- Status ‚Üí "Needs Human Review"
- Exit gracefully

### STEP 7: IMPLEMENTATION

**current_step = "implementation"**

**Go-specific implementation guidelines:**

- Use proper error handling patterns (error interface, wrapping errors)
- Implement proper context usage for cancellation/timeouts
- Follow Go interface design principles (small interfaces)
- Ensure goroutine safety where applicable
- Use Go modules properly for dependency management

**Code quality standards:**
- Run `gofmt -w .` on modified files
- Run `go vet ./...` to catch common issues
- Run `golint ./...` if available for style checks
- Follow effective Go principles for naming and structure
- Ensure proper documentation with Go doc comments
- Handle edge cases and error conditions appropriately

**Dependency management:**
- If adding new dependencies: `go get [package]`
- Update go.mod and go.sum as needed

---

## QUALITY ASSURANCE

### DEVELOPMENT WORK TYPES

Classify and handle different Go work types:

**GO FEATURE DEVELOPMENT:**
- New Go package/module creation
- New API endpoints or gRPC services
- Database integration with Go ORMs (GORM, sqlx)
- New CLI commands or subcommands
- Integration with external Go libraries
- Goroutine and channel implementations
- HTTP middleware and handlers

**GO BUG FIXES:**
- Reproduce issue first (add reproduction steps to JIRA)
- Root cause analysis with Go profiling tools (go tool pprof)
- Minimal fix approach to reduce risk
- Race condition fixes using `go test -race`
- Memory leak investigation and fixes
- Regression test creation mandatory
- Backward compatibility verification for public APIs

**GO REFACTORING:**
- Preserve existing functionality exactly
- Interface extraction and implementation
- Package reorganization and imports cleanup
- Performance optimization with benchmarks
- Comprehensive test coverage before changes
- Incremental commits for easy rollback
- Documentation updates for public APIs
- Go module dependency updates

**GO CONFIGURATION/DEPLOYMENT:**
- Dockerfile and container configuration
- Go build flags and cross-compilation setup
- Environment variable handling improvements
- Configuration file parsing (YAML, JSON, TOML)
- Logging and monitoring instrumentation
- Dependency version updates in go.mod
- Security patches and vulnerability fixes

For each type, adapt Go-specific testing strategy and risk assessment accordingly.

### CODE STANDARDS

Go-specific coding standards and best practices:

**FORMATTING AND STYLE:**
- Use gofmt for consistent formatting across all files
- Follow Go naming conventions (CamelCase for exported, camelCase for unexported)
- Use goimports to manage import statements properly
- Organize imports: standard library, third-party, local packages
- Keep line length reasonable (<120 characters when possible)

**DOCUMENTATION:**
- Write clear doc comments for all exported functions, types, and packages
- Follow Go documentation conventions (start with function/type name)
- Include examples in doc comments where helpful
- Update package-level documentation when adding new public APIs

**ERROR HANDLING:**
- Use idiomatic Go error handling patterns
- Wrap errors with context using fmt.Errorf with %w verb
- Create custom error types when appropriate
- Handle errors explicitly - never ignore error returns
- Use error sentinels for expected error conditions

**CONCURRENCY:**
- Use goroutines and channels appropriately
- Avoid data races - test with `go test -race`
- Use context.Context for cancellation and timeouts
- Follow goroutine lifecycle management best practices
- Use sync package primitives (Mutex, WaitGroup) when appropriate

**TESTING:**
- Follow Go testing conventions (TestXxx functions)
- Use table-driven tests for multiple test cases
- Write both unit and integration tests
- Use testing.T.Helper() for test helper functions
- Create comprehensive test coverage for error paths
- Use testify or similar libraries for assertions when helpful

**PACKAGE DESIGN:**
- Design small, focused interfaces
- Keep package API surface minimal and coherent
- Use internal packages for implementation details
- Follow semantic versioning for module releases
- Minimize external dependencies

### PR REQUIREMENTS

PR Description must include:
- JIRA ticket link
- Summary of changes made
- Testing performed
- Any breaking changes or migration notes
- Screenshots if UI changes

---

## EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS

### STUCK DETECTION

If current_step hasn't changed for > 2 hours:
1. JIRA comment: `"‚ö†Ô∏è Agent appears stuck on [current_step]. Escalating for review."`
2. Status ‚Üí "Needs Human Review"
3. Save detailed state to todo.json at `$TODO_JSON_PATH`
4. Exit gracefully

### CLEANUP ON EXIT

Always before exiting (success or failure):

**Immediate cleanup:**
1. Save current state to todo.json at `$TODO_JSON_PATH`
2. Add appropriate JIRA comments with timestamp
3. Add unlock comment if you had added lock: `"üîì AGENT_UNLOCK_[timestamp]"`

**Workspace management:**
4. For successful completion: Schedule cleanup in `$WORKSPACE_CLEANUP_HOURS` hours
5. For failures: Clean up immediately unless explicitly preserving for debug
6. Remove sensitive data (credentials, tokens) from workspace
7. Log workspace path for human reference if needed

**Resource cleanup:**
8. Close file handles and network connections
9. Clear temporary environment variables
10. Reset git credentials scope if modified
11. Free allocated memory/processes

**Final validation:**
12. Verify JIRA ticket status is correct
13. Confirm todo.json state is consistent
14. Log final status to system logs
15. Exit with appropriate code (0=success, >0=various failures)

---

## MONITORING COMMANDS

### HEALTH CHECK

Periodically verify:
- JIRA API connectivity
- Repository access
- File system permissions
- Network connectivity

### STATUS REPORTING

Structured logging to stdout (for monitoring systems):

Every 15 minutes:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "[ISO8601]",
  "agent_id": "[unique_id]",
  "ticket_id": "[current_ticket]",
  "current_step": "[step_name]",
  "elapsed_time": "[minutes]",
  "progress_percentage": "[0-100]",
  "workspace_path": "[temp_directory]",
  "memory_usage_mb": "[current_usage]",
  "disk_usage_mb": "[workspace_size]",
  "last_heartbeat": "[timestamp]",
  "status": "active|idle|error|completing"
}
```

**Critical events (immediate logging):**
- Ticket acquisition/completion
- Error conditions requiring human intervention
- Resource usage exceeding thresholds
- Authentication/permission issues
- Network connectivity problems

---

## CRITICAL REMINDERS

- **MANDATORY PRE-FLIGHT VALIDATION**: Never make code changes without completing full pre-flight validation first
- Work on ONLY ONE ticket at a time
- Update heartbeat every 30 minutes
- Handle errors gracefully with proper JIRA communication
- Always clean up resources before exiting
- Provide clear, actionable error messages for human escalation
- Respect agent locks from other processes
- Keep todo.json at `$TODO_JSON_PATH` state synchronized with actual progress
- Validate environment variables before processing tickets
- Never commit secrets or credentials to repositories
- Use structured logging for monitoring and debugging

## SECURITY & OPERATIONAL NOTES

- Check for emergency stop file at `$TODO_JSON_PATH.stop` - if exists, exit immediately
- Never log or commit sensitive data (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- Rotate temporary credentials after each ticket completion
- Validate all user inputs from JIRA tickets to prevent injection attacks
- Check ticket dependencies - if ticket has "Blocked by" links, verify blockers are resolved
- For database migrations, always create backup scripts and rollback procedures

---
